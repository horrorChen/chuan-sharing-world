## What is it?

This is a report template in `Markdown` format the Computer Architecture course at University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.

As the teaching assistants only provide the `.doc` format template, I hope this `Markdown` template could accelerating your report working time and leave you more time to work with Xlinx Vivado.

## How to use it?

As for myself, I use [typora](https://typora.io/) to save time, and the following configuration is all powered by `typora`.

### Get your own `.css` to override the default format of `GitHub` theme

**ADD** the `base.user.css` to your local folder `C:\Users\<userfolder>\AppData\Roaming\Typora\themes`, DON'T FORGET to change `<userfolder>` to your own folder name.

> Note: I just provide the basic settings in the `.css` file, please modify it as you like!

### Use the template like a `Markdown` user

If you are new to `Markdown`, please read [this article from LCTT's wiki](https://lctt.github.io/wiki/tutorials/copywriting.html) and find your own style of writing report with `Markdown`.

If you want to have customized format when exporting the report, you can use `html` tricks to beautify it.
